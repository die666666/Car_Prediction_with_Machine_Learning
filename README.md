# oibsip_taskno.3_Car_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning

This GitHub repository showcases a project focused on predicting car prices using various regression models. The dataset used is 'CarPrice_Assignment.csv'. Below, I'll walk you through the key steps of the project.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
To get started, we import essential libraries and load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. We then explore the dataset's shape, check for missing values, and examine the distribution of categorical data. We encode categorical variables as needed for further analysis.

Model Training
1. Linear Regression
We dive into model training with Linear Regression. First, the data is split into training and testing sets. The Linear Regression model is trained on the training data and then used to predict prices for both training and test datasets. We calculate R-squared errors to gauge the model's performance. Visualizations help us compare predicted and actual prices.

2. Lasso Regression
Continuing our model exploration, we move on to Lasso Regression. Similar to Linear Regression, we train a Lasso Regression model, predict prices on training and test sets, and compute R-squared errors. Visualizations once again aid in understanding the predictions' accuracy.

This project provides a practical example of using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression for predicting car prices. The code, explanations, and visualizations offer insights into the process and performance of these models.

Feel free to explore the repository and adapt the code for your own projects. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
